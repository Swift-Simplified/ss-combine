// << 🔵 Run Point
//: The completion block was called with a .finished value after each element in our array had been published.
//:
//: The completion enum contains two values; .finished and .failure. The .failure case has an associated value for handling errors. There's 3 different scenarios for this value; `Error`, `Never` or a custom value. `Never` is a special case, informing us that the publisher will Never fail.
//:
//: - Experiment:
//: We want to be notified when a our bucket list has new elements. Combine offers a property wrapper publisher that's not yet supported for top-level code - so let's embedd one within a class.

// << 🔵 Run Point 2
//: The contents of the array are now being publshed - not individual items one at a time. We're starting to see some differences of using a Combine property wrapper publisher!
//:
//: We also haven't recieved a completion block inidcating that the publisher has finished publishing. In fact, when we added a new element to our bucket list we recieved another notification. 😃
//: - Experiment:
//: Uncomment the Status enum logic and subscribe to the MyBucketList status property. Then change the status to .schedulingDates, .inProgress and .completed. Can you successfully get notified of each change?
