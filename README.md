# How To: 👈
# Use Combine 
in a Swift playground 🛝

[Download](https://github.com/Swift-Simplified/ss-combine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this Swift playground file to run the example given in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode).

## This Playground Teaches 👨🏻‍🏫
How to use the Combine framework in order to publish and subscribe to events.

Combine is an event publishing framework and broadcasts messages to subscribers who want to listen to changes in data. This Swift playground demonstrates how all the basics need to use Combine.

The code to publish and subscribe will look something like this:

```Swift
// MARK: - 📦 Sourcecode

var bucketListItems = ["skydiving", "travel", "triathalon", "snowboarding"]
let subscriber = bucketListItems.publisher.sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
    switch completion {
        case .finished:
            print("finished")
        case .failure(let error):
            print(error)
    }
}, receiveValue: { bucketListItem in
    print(bucketListItem)
})
// << 🔵 Run Point
```

## How To Download ⬇️
You can download this Swift playground by clicking the `Code` button at the top of this page. 

## How To Run The Playground 🏃🏾‍♂️
This repo stores a Swift playground file which are run and executed within [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) *(the tool used by developers to build apps)* and you simply need to double click the file.

## Why Learn In A Swift Playground 🛝
Swift playgrounds allow for rapid developmemt and provide a very fast and fluid thought-to-code process. There is no time taken to compile, build or install an app to an iOS simulator. Instead, the compilation time is fast and results are viewed almost immediately. 

The term "playground" is a very fitting name for both the feature and the file extension itself. It may be safe to assume that this feature was designed for "playing around"... or "learning" as we like to call it. 😆

## How To Become A Swift Engineer
Most companies that offer iOS developer jobs simply need to maintain an existing Swift system that has previoiusly been put in place. Creating the architecture and thinking about performance can be difficult and may require some expert knowledge, but they are not the needs of most companies. In fact, if you are interested in maintaining an existing system then the technology industry will be a huge market place in which to advertise your skills. 

With the interest of both parties in mind *(the business and the employee)* having great Swift knowledge and being able to write safe code will be the biggest focus - *which is great news!* 😃🥳🎉 

This means, all you need to do is 👉 **[learn Swift!](https://www.swiftsimplified.com/the-swift-handbook)** 👈

## Why Learn Swift
To become an iOS developer with a great salary who can work anywhere in the world using only a laptop and an internet connection. 

By studying the language all of the other pieces of the puzzle will fall into place. With a clear grasp of the Swift programming language it will be much easier to apply for jobs and to pass each test they provide. The rest will be provided to you as you learn whats required within that role for that specific company. 

**Step 1**: Learn Swift

**Step 2**: Get A Job  - *learn how to make apps*

**Step 3**: 🕺🏼💃🪩

## Support The Worlds no.1 Company 
Wouldn't it make sense to write software for the worlds no.1 most prifitable company? I mean.. if you want to gain a good career and live a wealthy lifestyle. 🤷🏼‍♂️

We are tyring to consolidate more than a decades commercial experience combined with the official Swift documentation into short online courses *(created for fast learning)*, so that our students can live happier and wealthier lives - simply by learning 1 language! 😎

Why not think about becoming an iOS developer making apps for Apple software. 🤔💭
